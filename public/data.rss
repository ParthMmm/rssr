<p>A strong sales organization is the tip of the spear for every SaaS startup, but because so few founders have meaningful experience in this arena, they don&#8217;t know how to set their teams up for success.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In this TC+ article, contributor Kevin Varadian explains how to chart a sales coaching journey that boosts retention and increases revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s important to recognize that today’s sales teams are more problem-solvers than deal-closers — soft skills are more important here than technical capabilities,&#8221; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s demo day season. This morning marked the kickoff of VC firm 500 Global&#8217;s Fall 2022 Demo Day, which saw over a dozen startups give their best pitches to prospective investors &#8212; and customers. Participants ran the gamut from fintech and sustainability to edtech and developer tools, and several stood out from the rest of the pack.</p>
<p>The event comes just weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/08/the-biggest-moonshots-in-ycs-s22-batch/">Y Combinator had its bi-annual Demo Day</a>, its first since moving operations back to in-person. 500 Global, <a href="https://500.co/theglobalvc/from-500-startups-to-500-global">formerly branded under 500 Startups</a>, has an accelerator that competes with YC. Both outfits look to back early-stage founders with money and advice in exchange for equity. YC has backed over 3,500 founders, while 500 Global has backed more than 2,800 founders, according to each institution&#8217;s websites. Unlike YC, 500 Global has geographic-specific accelerator programs, similar to Techstars, with focus on areas like Aichi, Japan, Cambodia, and Alberta, Canada.</p>
<p>That said, today&#8217;s debut from 500 Global is from its first and flagship program, hailing back from 2010 and, fittingly, including companies from all around the globe. All companies go through a four-month program but start at different times, thanks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/500-startups-moves-to-rolling-admissions-instead-of-cohorts/">to 500 Global&#8217;s somewhat new rolling admissions strategy.</a> Let&#8217;s dig into some of the moonshots of the batch and end with some notes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/claytonbryan/">Clayton Bryan</a>, partner and head of 500 Global’s Accelerator Fund.</p>
<h2>The moonshots</h2>
<p>For example, there&#8217;s Taiwan-based <a href="https://rosetta.ai/">Rosetta.ai</a>, an ecommerce startup tapping AI to let customers search for products &#8212; particularly apparel and cosmetic &#8212; through specific attributes. Rosetta&#8217;s AI algorithm &#8220;sees&#8221; which attributes (e.g., sleeveless, ruffled, microbeads) a shopper might want as they browse an online store and builds a &#8220;preference profile&#8221; for them, which merchants can use to cross-sell or set up promotions that trigger if it seems likely the shopper will abandon their cart.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s early days for Rosetta. But the company, which was founded in 2016, has raised $2.4 million in capital to date and claims to have customers including Shu Uemura, in which L&#8217;Oréal owns a majority stake. The trick will be continuing to win customers over rivals like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/24/lily-ai-lands-new-capital-to-help-retailers-match-customers-with-products/">Lily AI</a>, which similarly attempts to match customers with products using attributes and AI models.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on Demo Day, <a href="https://www.lydia.ai/">Lydia.ai</a> walked through its health assessment service for insurance carriers. Designed to do away with lengthy medical exams and forms, Lydia has insurance plan applicants answer a few questions about their health &#8212; e.g., whether they have a chronic illness, have recently been hospitalization and so on &#8212; via their smartphones. The platform then generates an abstracted health score supposedly devoid of sensitive medical details, which insurers can use for risk management and underwriting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Lydia isn&#8217;t the first to attempt this. Health tech startup Fedo also algorithmically generates health scores, quantifying a person&#8217;s risk for diseases and their propensity to claim. The opaqueness of Lydia&#8217;s approach also raises questions, like whether its algorithms account for demographic differences and historic biases in health care. But if the startup remains true to its mission &#8212; insuring the next billion people &#8212; it could be one to watch, particularly given the capital (~$13 million) already behind it.</p>
<p>One of the more unique Demo Say startups that presented was <a href="https://www.betastore.co/">BetaStore</a>, a supplier for the &#8220;informal&#8221; retail outlets common in Africa. Informal retailers are unlicensed and unregistered retailers that don&#8217;t report to tax agencies, typically operating out of open markets and shops. BetaStore serves as a goods marketplace for informal retailers, providing access to staples such as dish soap, laundry detergent and all-purpose cleaner at wholesale prices and delivering them to the retailers (within 48 hours).</p>

<p>BetaStore customers can order products via chat, text message or WhatsApp. On the backend, the platform provides sales analytics to manufacturers, which BetaStore notes can be leveraged to make &#8220;data-driven&#8221; decisions to scale up shipments.</p>
<p>BetaStore appears to be off to a strong start. Founded in 2020, the Nigeria-based startup claims to have distributed over 140,000 goods to retail customers in Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Senegal and fielded over 20,000 orders. Recently, BetaStore began offering financing to retailers and plans to launch a buy now, pay later product in the coming months.</p>
<h2>One year after the rebrand</h2>
<p>Minutes after Demo Day ended, Bryan spoke to TechCrunch about 500 Global and how it&#8217;s growing within an increasingly volatile (and competitive) market.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been kind of gloomy, but we&#8217;ve told our companies time and time again that the silver lining is that 2021 was a phenomenal year for venture funds raising financing,&#8221; he said, fitting into the news that<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/venture-firms-290-billion-dry-powder-is-about-to-revive-startup-funding"> U.S. based investors are sitting on $290 billion in dry powder right now. </a>The accelerator&#8217;s top advice was to start fundraising earlier, ready the company more before going out to the market, and stay smart on managing expenses. His advice these days is that startups should be preparing for at least 18 months of runway.</p>
<p><a href="https://500.co/theglobalvc/from-500-startups-to-500-global">It has been almost a year since 500 Global rebranded from 500 startups</a>, a move that Bryan said was meant to reposition the institution as less of an accelerator, and more of a venture firm. Its more than semantics; former batch participants have come back to 500 for follow-on funding, during their Series A but up till their series D.</p>
<p>&#8220;Historically, we haven&#8217;t had any any optionality, but now we&#8217;re going multi-strategy and we&#8217;re working on later stage funds,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have the demand with our founder community, we have a demand even within our partner community that they want to have access to more de-risked companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;We&#8217;re very proud of our accelerator. It is a key vantage&#8230;but now it&#8217;s helped unlock other opportunities for us as a firm that we&#8217;re exploring with a lot of enthusiasm.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for if 500 will change its investment cadence, check size or focus &#8211;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/14/y-combinator-is-still-paranoid/"> similar to YC as it prepared for a downturn</a> &#8211;  Bryan said there&#8217;s more to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not immune to the the changes that are happening in our ecosystem, we&#8217;re aware of what other funds are doing and other programs are doing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our program has been operating strongly for the last 10 plus years. But at the same time, we can&#8217;t rest on our laurels, and we&#8217;ve got to make sure that we have compelling deal terms.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Insurtech companies have been among the biggest victims of the public market selloff, especially those that went public in 2021. Notably, Metromile saw its valuation decline over 85% and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/29/lemonade-closes-on-acquisition-of-insurtech-metromile-promptly-lays-off-about-20-of-its-staff/">subsequently acquired by peer Lemonade</a>, and it hasn&#8217;t been alone in losing a lot of value and being eyed by peers and incumbents.</p>
<p>All this M&amp;A activity and repricing in the public insurtech cohort left us wondering about their private peers: Are the same trends at play, and to what extent?</p>
<p>Investors across North America and Europe agreed that while insurtech has suffered as investors sought out more profitable sectors, the sector is still alive and thriving. &#8220;I do not believe the insurtech market to be dead, because it is still a multi-billion-dollar market,&#8221; Hélène Falchier, partner at Portage Ventures, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Short term, it might be more difficult to raise at valuations we have seen before the public market adjustment, but with a strong business model and an experienced management team that understands the market and growth KPIs, it is possible,” she said.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>We&#8217;re widening our lens, looking for more — and more diverse — investors to include in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/techcrunchplus/investor-surveys/">TechCrunch surveys</a> where we poll top professionals about challenges in their industry.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you&#8217;re an investor who&#8217;d like to participate in future surveys, fill out <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4hy272nt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this form</a>.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>While leagues behind fintech as a whole, insurtech startups have still attracted a significant amount of investment over the last few years — $43 billion between 2016 and 2022, according to a recent <a href="https://dealroom.co/reports/the-state-of-european-insurtech-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>. That level of interest can&#8217;t have vanished entirely, but there will definitely be winners and losers.</p>
<p>David Wechsler, a principal at OMERS Ventures, is clear that some private insurtechs will struggle to raise their next round of funding, but the downturn is not as bad as the doomers and gloomers make it out to be.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are simply seeing a reality check happen,” he said. “If the last round was done at too high of a valuation, the market will force it back in line. Unfortunately, there are many companies that should not have raised as much as they did, or perhaps don’t have sustainable business models. These companies will struggle to survive.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the absence of easy funding, the insurtech private market seems ripe for M&amp;A, several investors pointed out. “As insurtech valuations have become more realistic, many companies are probing, looking for M&amp;A opportunities,” Wechsler said. “I believe the next 12 to 18 months will have lots of interesting deals really invigorating the ecosystem and creating a lot more excitement for investors to come back in, and at the correct prices.”</p>
<p>This leaves us with questions: What seals the fate of private insurtech startups these days? Have some approaches entirely fallen out of favor? Which avenues enjoy new tailwinds?</p>

<h2>Martha Notaras, general partner, Brewer Lane Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>The public-market insurtech selloff has clearly trickled down to private dealmaking. Do you expect late-stage insurtech investment volume and valuations to fall further than what we have already seen this year? </strong></p>
<p>The decline in valuations of the first batch of insurtech IPOs has changed the rules: Investors are more focused on proof of sales traction and time to profitability. Late-stage insurtech funding is now a lot more variable – everyone won’t get a trophy, as they did in 2021.</p>
<p>But good companies with strong leaders who are converting revenue to a path to profitability are continuing to get funded at mutually acceptable valuations.</p>
<p><strong>Insurtech IPOs don&#8217;t seem to be on the cards for 2022. Does that make it OK for founders to say when fundraising that they are hoping their company will be acquired?</strong></p>
<p>If startups are focused primarily on a trade sale, they need to be disciplined about how much capital they raise in order to deliver a good outcome for all.</p>
<p>VC return expectations might deliver valuations that a founder perceives as too low. That might mean some insurtechs could go for alternative funding sources that are less sensitive to exit valuations, including strategic investors, who are looking to gain non-monetary rewards as well as investment returns.</p>
<p>Regardless of what founders aspire to, not every startup gets to IPO even in the best times. And not all trade sales are at disappointing prices, as Adobe just showed with the Figma deal.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the most likely acquirers of insurtech startups right now: Legacy insurance companies, or private equity funds?</strong></p>
<p>These two sets of buyers are solving for different use cases, so both are likely acquirers of different insurtechs.</p>
<p>Smart legacy insurance companies are looking for insurtechs that have great technology, but not enough customers or premium volume to get the most value out of the technology. The legacy insurance companies will look to leverage technology that they wished they had created, across premiums that they already know how to sell.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			For later-stage insurtechs that raised a subsequent amount of money at a high valuation, an M&amp;A exit is unlikely without a price cut.							<cite>Clarisse Lam, associate, New Alpha Asset Management</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>PE funds will look for insurtechs that can keep growing and can benefit from the classic PE approach of leveraging operations and bolting on other acquisitions.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to 2021, when there was a greater focus on growth over revenue, which business models or approaches are now seeing lower investment interest due to unclear paths to profitability?</strong></p>
<p>The mantra in 2022 is definitely “how and when can you get to profitability,” in contrast to 2021’s approach of “if you’re not growing the top line by over 5x, you’re not really trying.” DTC insurtechs with high CAC [customer acquisition cost] and no proprietary source of leads have a tougher time finding investors today.</p>
<p>I have always liked B2B insurtechs with recurring revenue models, and now other investors are focusing on these opportunities as well. But startups still need to make sure they are focused on markets that can deliver substantial revenue growth in order to achieve the profits that are now required.</p>
<p><strong>Which insurtech business models have the most in-market traction today, and are those the same models that venture investors are investing in?</strong></p>
<p>There are several MGAs and technology-driven, full-stack insurance carriers that have built impressive premium bases, including in newer risk categories like cyber. Venture investors have recently become more selective about investing in MGAs before they achieve scale. This caution reflects current public-market trading, as investors project forward to exit.</p>
<p>[Editor&#8217;s note: As David Wechsler <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/03/armed-with-experience-insurtech-mgas-are-paving-the-way-for-insurtech-2-0/">previously noted in a guest post</a>, &#8220;a managing general agent (MGA) is a hybrid between an insurance agency (policy sales) and insurance carrier (underwriting and assumption of the risk).&#8221;]</p>
<p>I see investor enthusiasm for B2B insurtechs with a recurring revenue model. Many of these startups are delivering efficiency and cost savings to traditional insurers, and those existing insurers have become more receptive to bringing in startups to solve difficult operating problems.</p>
<p><strong>How does the insurtech landscape in emerging markets compare to developed markets? How does Europe measure up?</strong></p>
<p>In emerging markets, insurtech is following the path of fintech, where we are seeing fast followers of models that have worked elsewhere. The pace of innovation and funding outside of the U.S. has picked up significantly in the past three years.</p>
<p>Historically, European insurtechs have had less access to funding than U.S. startups. I am starting to see insurtechs that started in Europe are targeting problems that are relevant regardless of geography. Some of these are getting impressive traction.</p>
<p><strong>How much have early-stage insurtech deals slowed in 2022? Are they falling back to pre-COVID levels?</strong></p>
<p>The reality of falling back to pre-COVID levels brings up a really good point: 18 months of rising valuations does not represent sustainable reality. So the doom and gloom overstates the issue.</p>
<p>That said, deals have slowed, and insurtechs that have raised in this environment are either stars, or have adjusted their valuation expectations to the new rules in the market. The other factor that is constraining external fundraising is existing investors providing bridge financing, either in the form of convertible notes or round extensions.</p>
<p>In some cases, this is postponing the inevitable. But the positive view is that the startup’s existing investors have faith in the vision and want to extend the runway until new investors get excited by the company’s prospects.</p>
<p>Deals are taking longer in 2022 because investors are doing more thoughtful due diligence. I am no longer hearing stories of startups getting term sheets following a 30-minute conversation. Our team is a proponent of value-add due diligence, seeking to ask questions that not only inform the investor, but also reframe the situation, providing new perspectives and insight for the operating team as well. This year feels like a time when investors are embracing due diligence, and I think the resulting investments will be a lot stronger as a result.</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about insurtech companies innovating beyond technology?</strong></p>
<p>We have certainly moved beyond Insurtech 1.0, where it was enough to digitize an insurance transaction with an improved customer interface. Now, insurtechs are looking to use technology not only to distribute insurance more effectively, but to change the product and the risk profile of the product. This feels like the natural path of evolution, and it’s why the insurtechs today are even more compelling investments than the pioneers.</p>
<p><strong>How is the insurtech sector responding to the climate crisis? What more can possibly be done with social impact more broadly?</strong></p>
<p>You’ve hit on an area I am particularly interested in – the intersection of climate and insurtech. Yes, I have seen some innovations on climate. Insurtechs are offering parametric insurance, which can make difficult risks insurable. Others are tracking climate risk, and finding ways to neutralize climate risk that are not just cosmetic, like carbon offsets.</p>
<p>I hope to see more insurtechs addressing these truly hard problems. Today’s combination of technology, very granular data and access to processing power create the conditions for some strong startups. Insurtechs are going to have to be part of this effort; existing insurers have the will to change, but I think insurtechs will deliver the actual solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Are you open to cold pitches? How can founders reach you? </strong></p>
<p>Sure. All investors pass on more investments than they make, but I’ll do my best to respond quickly and thoughtfully. Reach me at <a href="mailto:Martha@brewerlane.com">martha@brewerlane.com</a>.</p>
<h2>David Wechsler, principal, OMERS Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>The public-market insurtech selloff has clearly trickled down to private dealmaking. Do you expect late-stage insurtech investment volume and valuations to fall further than what we have already seen this year?  </strong></p>
<p>Yes, I suspect that in the public eye, earlier- and later-stage valuations will continue to decrease. However, this may be simply a product of deals working through the system. In other words, many of these deals are done or well underway and are yet to be announced. Strong companies that raised at realistic valuations over the past one to two years will not feel as great of an impact. There will even be up rounds.</p>
<p>We are simply seeing a reality check happen. If the last round was done at too high of a valuation, the market will force it back in line. Unfortunately, there are many companies that should not have raised as much as they did, or perhaps don’t have sustainable business models. These companies will struggle to survive.</p>
<p><strong>Insurtech IPOs don&#8217;t seem to be on the cards for 2022. Does that make it OK for founders to say when fundraising that they are hoping their company will be acquired?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Selling a business can be a great outcome for both entrepreneurs and investors. However, the absolute dollars paid tend to be less than an IPO. As such, entrepreneurs need to raise capital accordingly.</p>
<p>If your business plan requires a tremendous amount of capital, you are limiting the number of potential acquirers. Entrepreneurs need to be thoughtful in showing how a capital-efficient model can result in building a business that is attractive to acquirers, and paint a realistic picture of who those acquirers might be.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the most likely acquirers of insurtech startups right now: Legacy insurance companies, or private equity funds?</strong></p>
<p>“Insurtech” is a broad category and refers not only to next-gen insurers, but also vendors of tools and technology for the insurance ecosystem. Potential acquirers include not only traditional insurance carriers and private equity funds, you also have tech vendors looking to go deeper into the insurance market.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div><p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/29/8-investors-weigh-in-on-the-state-of-insurtech-in-q3-2022/">8 investors weigh in on the state of insurtech in Q3 2022</a> by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com/author/anna-heim/">Anna Heim</a> originally published on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When insurtech company Metromile <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/pay-per-mile-auto-insurer-metromile-is-heading-to-public-markets-via-spac/">went public</a> via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in February last year, it was valued at over $1 billion. A year and five months later, Lemonade <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/29/lemonade-closes-on-acquisition-of-insurtech-metromile-promptly-lays-off-about-20-of-its-staff/">acquired the company</a> for less than $145 million.</p>
<p>As the markets turned early this year, insurtech left most generalist investors’ playbooks almost as fast as Metromile and its peers’ plummeting valuations. Yet, the sector is very much alive, and the “correction” of these companies’ valuations presents an opportunity for those who have cash left on their balance sheets, investors told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Just like how not every insurtech was a unicorn last year, not all of them are worth zero today,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-graillot-56a1aba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florian Graillot</a>, founding partner at <a href="http://astorya.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astorya.vc</a>.</p>
<p>The insurtech market has been through a rough time this past year, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/29/8-investors-weigh-in-on-the-state-of-insurtech-in-q3-2022/">we reached out to eight active investors in the space</a> to get a read of what’s been cooking as the markets aggressively recalibrated what an insurtech startup is worth.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>We&#8217;re widening our lens, looking for more — and more diverse — investors to include in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/techcrunchplus/investor-surveys/">TechCrunch surveys</a> where we poll top professionals about challenges in their industry.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you&#8217;re an investor who&#8217;d like to participate in future surveys, fill out <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4hy272nt">this form</a>.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>“From an M&amp;A perspective, it’s a matter of price versus positioning,” Graillot said. “If you are solving a real pain point as an enterprise software company, tech providers or insurers might be interested in acquiring you. For DTC players offering personal or commercial insurance policies, if you’ve cracked the online acquisition challenge, you are worth something, and corporates might be interested in you to boost their own internal initiatives,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The players involved in these deals might go beyond the usual suspects, too. On one hand, private equity funds won&#8217;t be interested in companies that don&#8217;t have a clear path to profitability. On the other, &#8220;the growing interest and value of embedded insurance may bring nontraditional companies into the acquisition arena,&#8221; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewechsler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Wechsler</a>, principal at <a href="https://www.omersventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OMERS Ventures</a>, said.</p>
<p>The bulk of the buyers, however, would likely be companies involved in insurance themselves – either insurtechs acquiring some of their peers or legacy players. For <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarisse-lam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clarisse Lam</a>, associate at <a href="https://www.newalpha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Alpha Asset Management</a>, this makes sense: &#8220;The repricing represents a great opportunity for incumbents to make strategic acquisitions and accelerate their digital transformation. This may actually be a great moment for insurtechs to nurture their relationship with incumbents to work on synergies and potential trade sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>VC money is definitely drying up for some, such as neo-insurers whose unit economics are under scrutiny. But other insurtech business models are seeing increasing interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see investor enthusiasm for B2B insurtechs with a recurring revenue model,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marthanotaras/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martha Notaras</a>, a general partner at <a href="https://www.brewerlane.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brewer Lane Ventures</a>, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Many of these startups are delivering efficiency and cost savings to traditional insurers, and those existing insurers have become more receptive to bringing in startups to solve difficult operating problems.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are times in the life of a startup when you don&#8217;t really want or need to raise money, but an opportunity comes along that&#8217;s so good that you create a brand new round just to be able to bring in a strategic investor.</p>
<p>That was the situation Danish animation and motion capture company <a href="https://www.rokoko.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rokoko</a> found itself in over the summer. I wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/17/rokoko-fundraise/">its $3 million strategic round</a> that valued the company at $80 million — a round pulled together specifically to let <a href="https://zepeto.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zepeto</a> buy its way onto Rokoko&#8217;s cap table.</p>
<p>When that sort of thing happens, you typically don&#8217;t need an in-depth deck; the investor is already pretty sure they want to invest, and you&#8217;re pretty sure you want the investor. Besides, if the deal doesn&#8217;t happen &#8230; whatevz, you didn&#8217;t need the money anyway.</p>
<p>When I talked with Rokoko, I found myself wondering: What were they using as a deck in this very specific circumstance? Luckily, the company&#8217;s CEO was happy to share the deck with me. So for this week&#8217;s pitch deck teardown, I&#8217;ve got something slightly unusual: a strategic extension deck!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look.</p>

<h2>Three things to love</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re building a company in the creator space, you&#8217;d best have a beautiful deck. And oh my actual goodness does Rokoko deliver on that front.</p>
<h3>Utter clarity</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2411240" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2411240" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2411240" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-2.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-2.jpg?resize=1200,674 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2411240" class="wp-caption-text">[Slide 2] Problem slide. <strong>Image Credit</strong>: Rokoko</p></div>The team at Rokoko is all about motion and the capturing thereof. How the ever-loving hell do you capture that in a still-frame slide deck? Well, Slide 2 gives you the answer. This slide is an absolute masterpiece of storytelling. By contextualizing a human in motion next to a digital counterpart, Rokoko displays in a single side-by-side what it does.</p>
<p>The photograph is great, of course, and it evokes motion and movement. Anyone who&#8217;s ever tried animating something by hand knows how hard it is to get movement to look natural. The two images go a long way, and the text further rams home the point: We are living in a universe where a wide range of motion needs to be captured in order to make animators&#8217; lives easier. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine that that&#8217;s true for games, animated movies, and much more. I love the simplicity of this slide and how much work it does. It&#8217;s a great way to establish the conversation.</p>
<h3>A big market with big adjacent markets</h3>
<p>You know all that praise I just heaped on Rokoko above? It gets better. I&#8217;m already convinced that this is a good opportunity, but then they go and tell us that there&#8217;s a huge amount of additional opportunities as well:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2411702" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2411702" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2411702" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-4.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-4.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-4.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-4.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-4.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-4.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-4.jpg?resize=1200,674 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-4.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2411702" class="wp-caption-text">[Slide 4] Adjacent markets. <strong>Image Credit</strong>: Rokoko</p></div><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If you&#8217;re building a company in the creator space, you&#8217;d best have a beautiful deck. And oh my actual goodness does Rokoko deliver on that front.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>It makes sense that creators — especially low and mid-budget games and animation producers — are a big and growing market. Seeing that Rokoko has thought about (and is executing against) a market expansion is exactly what investors want to see.</p>
<p>For a lot of companies, I would push back at this point, saying that this is fragmentation and lack of focus, but I really like how Rokoko tells the story in this instance: They are thinking about health and life sciences, web3, sports, and other use cases, but they&#8217;re not making a big deal out of it. It shows that they are keeping tabs on things without really diverting too many resources. At least, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hoping. If I were looking to invest, I&#8217;d ask them how many resources they are using, but given how this slide is designed and worded, I&#8217;m confident that they&#8217;re running some pilots/early tests.</p>
<p>The outlier is &#8220;Robotics and Automotive,&#8221; where the company casually drops the fact that they have Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Ford, and Mercedes as existing customers. That&#8217;s underplaying what&#8217;s going on, but it&#8217;s a great way to tell this part of the story. Yes, there&#8217;s a flurry of questions immediately jumping to mind: How are they using your product? What are the contracts worth? How did you get them? What can you do to grow your presence there? How can you pick up even more robotics and automotive clients? But as far as the storytelling goes, it hints at a solid core market (creators) and a plethora of potentially lucrative market extensions. It&#8217;s a great place to be as a startup.</p>
<h3>Oh and about those creators &#8230;</h3>
<p>The first time I clicked through Rokoko&#8217;s deck, I was confused about the ordering; I would have switched slides 4 and 5. But thinking about it more closely, I see what they are doing. Instead of doing a &#8220;this is our core and here are the other opportunities,&#8221; they are doing it the other way around. Slide 4 shows the lay of the land and then Slide 5 drills deeper at the core audiences, showing that there&#8217;s a huge growth opportunity.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2411728" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2411728" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2411728" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-5.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-5.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-5.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-5.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-5.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-5.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-5.jpg?resize=1200,674 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RokokoStrategicExtensionPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-5.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2411728" class="wp-caption-text">[Slide 5] About those creators &#8230; <strong>Image Credit</strong>: Rokoko</p></div>This slide tells such an important part of Rokoko&#8217;s story &#8212; Slide 4 covered the overall landscape, and here the company double-clicks on the creator economy; the additional context shows where amateur and low-end pro producers are putting their content. And it&#8217;s encouraging to see that the company has space to grow into more high-end content, too, produced by the likes of Disney+, Apple TV+, Hulu, HBO Max, Prime Video and Netflix. It shows the width and breadth of the customers who are using these services.</p>
<p>This round is all about bringing in an investor who already wants to be involved, so I&#8217;ll forgive Rokoko for this, but if this were a more general VC round, I&#8217;d invite them to talk more about what that &#8220;strong growth&#8221; looks like in numbers.</p>
<p>In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things Rokoko could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn has begun production of Lordstown Motors&#8217;s electric pickup truck.</p>
<p>The news, which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/foxconn-starts-ev-production-in-us-with-first-lordstown-pickups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> grabbed first, is a milestone for both companies: Foxconn as it diversifies from manufacturing consumer electronics like iPhones to electric vehicles, and Lordstown as it finally gets its much-anticipated Endurance truck off production lines and, hopefully, into customers&#8217; hands.</p>
<p>Ever since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/lordstown-motors-becomes-latest-ev-automaker-to-use-a-spac-to-go-public/">going public</a> via a special purpose acquisition (SPAC) merger in 2020 &#8212; a move that, in hindsight, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/13/why-ev-startups-shouldve-hit-the-brakes-before-merging-with-a-spac/">spelling doom for most EV SPACs</a> &#8212; Lordstown has struggled to get to production. Last summer, the company issued a growing concern warning that it might not have enough funds to bring its EV to market, but was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/troubled-ev-company-lordstown-motors-gets-400m-lifeline-in-stock-sale-agreement/">bailed out by an investment firm that agreed to purchase $400 million worth of shares</a> over a three-year period.</p>
<p>The company further shed some weight by selling off its Lordstown, Ohio factory, which it had previously purchased from General Motors, to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/foxconn-buys-lordstown-motors-ohio-factory-for-230m-plans-to-help-produce-endurance-electric-pickup/"> Foxconn for $230 million</a>. Foxconn agreed to make Lordstown&#8217;s EVs for it, but the company will also use the Ohio factory to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/fisker-and-foxconn-sign-deal-to-build-electric-vehicles/">produce EVs for Fisker</a>, another EV SPAC.</p>
<p>The production volume of the Endurance pickup will ramp slowly, with a slight crescendo in November and December, because of those pesky supply chain constraints, according to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lordstown-motors-begins-commercial-production-of-endurance-pickup-truck-301636661.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> from Lordstown. Very slowly, it seems. So far, two commercial release production vehicles have rolled off Foxconn&#8217;s production line, with the third &#8220;expected to be completed shortly.&#8221; Three almost down, 47 to go &#8212; Lordstown intends to deliver about 50 units to customers beginning in the fourth quarter, and the rest of the first batch of 500 units in the first half of 2023, if it can raise more money.</p>
<p>That caveat is key, and is possibly one of the reasons why, despite this milestone, Lordstown&#8217;s shares are down 7.18% at 12:00 p.m. ET. Turns out building electric vehicles from the ground up is incredibly difficult and expensive, a hard truth that fellow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/30/nikola-lucid-latest-ev-spacs-trying-to-raise-cash/">EV SPACs Nikola and Lucid Motors</a> are also coming to grips with as they, too, try to raise additional capital.</p>
<p>Lordstown said it will end the quarter and the year with about $195 million and $110 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. But that&#8217;s likely not enough to scale production. To make it past 50 pickups, the company is looking to its old pal Foxconn, as well as other strategic partners, to get the cash it needs to keep this business going. As part of Foxconn&#8217;s purchase of the Ohio factory, the two companies entered into a<a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-and-foxconn-close-asset-purchase-agreement-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> joint venture to co-develop EV programs</a>, and it&#8217;s this spring that Lordstown will attempt to tap. Foxconn, which owns 55% of the JV, already loaned Lordstown $45 million to support the EV-maker&#8217;s own capital commitment to the JV.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Foxconn&#8217;s reputation for delivering isn&#8217;t exactly pristine, either. The company has struggled to get a planned $10 billion LCD factory in Wisconsin off the ground &#8212; a project that former U.S. President Donald Trump once called &#8220;the eighth wonder of the world.&#8221; Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/foxconn-mostly-abandons-10-billion-wisconsin-project-touted-by-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foxconn reduced its planned investment</a> in the factory to a measly $672 million and cut the number of new jobs to 1,454 from 13,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://getreflect.io/">Reflect</a>, a new analytics tool that has been specifically designed for HR teams. While many teams now rely on sophisticated data visualization and business planning tools, HR teams can’t easily measure different metrics and see how they evolve over time.</p>
<p>And yet, human resources have become a key component for tech startups and innovative businesses in general.</p>
<p>“The reason why we started Reflect is that we thought HR people needed some help,” co-founder and CEO Léopold Adam told me. The job has gotten a lot more complex with the COVID-19 pandemic, diversity, equity and inclusion objectives, mental health issues and remote work policies.</p>
<p>“They don’t have a comprehensive tool to manage the situation,” Adam said. According to him, the average HR team uses 2 to 10 different software-as-a-service products. Reflect connects to all these tools and centralizes the data.</p>
<p>After that, Reflect acts as a single repository for all HR metrics. Users can then select data points and track progress. For instance, companies use Reflect to track the total headcount in each department, attrition, the number of salary increases per quarter, the proportion of women in leadership positions, etc.</p>
<p>Reflect then lets you share a dashboard with team managers, executives and anyone who want a comprehensive view of HR data in general. And once the CEO is using the tool, you can be sure that it will become essential.</p>
<p>Of course, many companies create Excel spreadsheets and send them across the company. But that requires a ton of manual exports and it’s not that easy to change some parameters to see a different view.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some companies already have a data visualization tool like Tableau and Power BI. But the issue is that HR departments deal with sensitive info, like salaries and sick leaves. You don’t want to grant access to your HR data to the entire company.</p>
<p>In the future, Reflect thinks it can help you compare your own metrics with your industry’s metrics. As more companies start using the product, it will become easier to compare attrition for instance.</p>
<p>Reflect raised a €2 million ($2 million) pre-seed round led by XAnge with the participation of Evolem, Kima Ventures and several business angels, such as Roxanne Varza, Matthieu Birach and Thibaud Elzière. And the first companies using the product include Pennylane, Welcome to the Jungle, Batch, Partoo and SmallPDF.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The IPO market is still frozen like a Nordic lake dotted with fishing huts, but there are signs that a thaw is now in sight.</p>
<p>News <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andreessen-horowitz-tripactions-has-filed-confidentially-for-an-ipo-2022-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Insider</a> indicates that TripActions, a unicorn in the corporate travel and expense category, has filed confidential paperwork to go public. Per the publication, the company is targeting a Q2 2023 public debut at around a $12 billion price tag. (Bloomberg&#8217;s Katie Roof, a former TechCruncher, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-04/travel-firm-tripactions-is-said-to-near-confidential-ipo-filing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> that TripActions was eyeing an IPO).</p>
<p>The news warmed our hearts, as we have heartily missed S-1 filings, a particular flavor of startup news that we feasted on during the 2021 boom but were forced to learn to live without this year as falling public-market prices and lackluster returns from some prior debuts slammed shut the IPO window a few quarters back.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="N6lFMZWFKP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/23/instacart-clears-path-to-ipo/">Instacart clears path to IPO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Instacart clears path to IPO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/23/instacart-clears-path-to-ipo/embed/#?secret=OUfWven6ir#?secret=N6lFMZWFKP" data-secret="N6lFMZWFKP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mix in the fact that we are &#8212; still &#8212; expecting a late-2022 Instacart S-1 filing and perhaps even debut, we now have not merely two IPOs on our dockets, but two potential <em>deca</em>corn public offerings. These are going to be big, noisy, large-dollar transactions that will provide valuable data concerning market appetite for tech shares generally and shed light on two important startup sectors&#8217; respective worth. Hell yeah, we&#8217;re excited. Nothing like a little new data to fill in the gaps in our understanding of today&#8217;s market.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;re going to discuss what we hope to learn from each IPO filing and which startups will be impacted by those particular data points.</p>

The pandemic didn&#8217;t help its business right away &#8212; in fact, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/tripactions-reportedly-lays-off-hundreds-amid-covid-19-travel-freeze/">it roughed it up a little</a>. But the company shook up its model, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/from-0-in-revenue-to-a-7-25b-valuation-why-tripactions-275m-raise-has-fintech-to-thank/">expanding its product mix in the process</a>, and now, with business travel coming back, is apparently satisfied with its results to the point where an IPO is in the cards.</p>
<h2>S-1 hopes, IPO dreams</h2>
<p>Starting with Instacart because it&#8217;s ground that we&#8217;ve trod before, we know that the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/19/keeping-financial-tabs-on-instacart-as-it-preps-its-ipo/">revenue is accelerating</a> and that it reached terrific scale thanks to COVID-19 shifting consumer behavior closer to its product.</p>
<p>We also recently learned that the company is <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instacart-cuts-staff-curbs-hiring-in-run-up-to-ipo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slowly trimming staff</a>, likely to get its profit metrics in the right spot to sell stock to public-market investors; the word of the day is <em>profit</em>, or perhaps &#8220;efficiency instead of merely growth,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/what-are-the-new-must-hit-startup-metrics/">after all</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In sub-Saharan Africa, only 33% of the urban population has access to public transportation, compared to 75% in Europe and North America, according to<a href="https://news.trust.org/item/20220211111139-pi31w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> UN statistics</a>. That means that most of the continent faces challenges chasing new job opportunities, going to school, accessing healthcare and just having a night on the town.</p>
<p>This lack of access to transportation is in stark contrast to other upward metrics on the African continent, like its growing access to equitable education and healthcare. In fact, Africa has the largest return on education of any continent, with each year of schooling raising earnings by<a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/466661539712226332/pdf/130910-WP-PUBLIC-HCP-in-Africa-booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 11% for boys and 14% for girls</a>. The combination of an increasingly educated workforce and still-sucky public transportation means the way people move is ripe for disruption.<a href="http://treepz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Treepz</a>, the Nigerian startup that&#8217;s scaling its bus-hailing service across the continent, might be one of the main drivers of that disruption.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;We can’t continue to complain about the downturn. I’d say it’s helping us become sturdier.&#8221;							<cite>Treepz CEO Onyeka Akumah</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Since Treepz, formerly Plentywaka, was founded in 2019 in Lagos, the startup has expanded west into Ghana and east into Uganda. Co-founder and CEO Onyeka Akumah said those locations will serve as launchpads for further expansion across the sub-Saharan region.</p>
<p>We caught up with Akumah,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/plentywaka-founder-onyeka-akumah-on-african-startups-and-global-expansion/"> whom we first interviewed a year ago</a>, to check in on Treepz&#8217;s progress and discuss why a conservative funding environment makes for better business, how the African startup scene is maturing, and what it takes to succeed in transportation technology.</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: You last closed<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/nigerian-maas-startup-treepz-closes-2-8m-seed-round-to-fund-east-african-expansion/"> a $2.8 million seed round in November</a>. I’m assuming you’re currently raising for your Series A. How are you finding the funding environment amid the economic downturn?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Onyeka Akumah: </strong>We are preparing to raise our Series A, and we already have some interest. Some of our current investors want to invest, but they’re waiting for us to go to market. We were about to go to market before the downturn in the economy hit.</p>
<p>The funding environment has changed, certainly, with the downturn. The funding cycle used to be around six months for a round to pull through, and now we&#8217;re seeing it take 12 to 18 months to close. You’re seeing investors make a lot more time for due diligence.</p>

With its first product, <a href="https://www.7analytics.no/project-1?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FloodCube</a>, 7Analytics serves customers with AI and advanced machine learning techniques to calculate current surface water and where it&#8217;s flowing today (the &#8220;runoff&#8221;), then models how that will look in the future with increased rainfall.</p>
<p>So in effect, FloodCube is more about predicting <em>how</em> a flood will unfold, showing exactly where water is likely to accumulate based on various environmental factors. While it&#8217;s possible to achieve this already today through combining multiple software programs and manual calculations, FloodCube brings everything together under one roof.</p>

<h2>Show me the data</h2>
<p>As with just about any AI and ML-infused software, large datasets are pivotal to 7Analytics&#8217; promise &#8212; it gathers data from openly available sources spanning digital elevation models (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEM</a>) for terrain, satellite imaging and climate data, then integrates these sources to make it easier for users to derive insights from. Its customers include the Municipality of Bergen, where 7Analytics is headquartered, multinational construction giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanska" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skanska</a> and engineering consultancy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiconsult" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiconsult</a>. And this gives a strong indication as to <em>who</em> 7Analytics is targeting, and who is most likely to care about predicting future flooding scenarios &#8212; protecting urban infrastructure is very much the name of the game here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, most developers and real estate owners know very little about their exposure to flood risk,&#8221; 7Analytics co-founder Jonas Toland told TechCrunch. &#8220;We close this gap with a high-precision risk tool.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While its technology is mainly used by construction companies in Norway for now, 7Analytics is expanding into new areas such as energy infrastructure, and is currently in talks with a handful of energy companies in the U.S. To help, 7Analytics&#8217; has partnered with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StormGeo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StormGeo</a>, a weather service and meteorological company that essentially tailors risk data for specific business use cases &#8212; such as disaster management in ship-routing, or energy production sites. In short, 7Analytics is helping StormGeo &#8220;enhance&#8221; its existing offering to its oil and gas customers, which includes companies in Houston, Texas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our product takes a real-time StormGeo weather forecast &#8212; for example, the risk of rainfall tomorrow &#8212; and translates it into actionable risk info, such as their site is at risk of x-inches of flooding tomorrow,&#8221; Toland explained. &#8220;This information can be used to inform them whether their staff will be able to use the parking lot, or to reroute supply trucks [for example].&#8221;</p>
<h2>Startups to the rescue?</h2>
<p>Recent data from reinsurance company Swiss Re suggests that extreme global weather events <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/global-weather-disasters-cost-101-billion-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost insurers $101 billion last year</a>, apparently only the third time since 1970 this figure has surpassed $100 billion. And Hurricane Ida alone reportedly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-environment-and-nature-louisiana-392d8001a9c69df607d9a7b5b84474fa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused at least $50 billion in damages</a>, depending on which figures we&#8217;re to believe. As such, we&#8217;re seeing all manner of climate-tech startups enter the fray, even companies that weren&#8217;t initially focused on climate at all. Yesterday, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/vrais-brings-vr-simulation-training-to-offshore-wind-and-other-hazardous-industries/">wrote about a six-year-old company called VRAI</a>, which initially delivered VR simulation training to the aerospace and defence sectors, but is now expanding into renewable energy, where it will focus on helping to upskill the European workforce and support plans to increase offshore wind energy capacity in the coming decade.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Australia&#8217;s FloodMapp <a href="https://www.floodmapp.com/post/union-square-ventures-leads-floodmapp-s-6m-seed-round" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently raised</a> $8.5 million to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/floodmapp-climate-change-flooding/">serve real-time flood forecasts</a>, while last year we wrote about New York-based Forerunner, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/forerunner-flood-management/">is developing a flood plain management platform</a>.</p>
<p>To take things to the next level now that it&#8217;s officially entered the U.S. market, 7Analytics today announced that it has raised $2.5 million in a seed round of funding led by sustainability-focused VC firm <a href="https://momentumpartners.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Momentum Partners</a>, with participation from <a href="https://www.constructventure.no/?locale=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Construct Venture</a> and Obos VC. While this funding will help 7Analytics expand both in Europe and the U.S., the company said that it eventually plans to use its technology to model for other &#8220;nature risks,&#8221; including landslides and biodiversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything we build is rigged for global use, so we are scaling our model fast across continents,&#8221; Toland said. &#8220;At the same time, we need to consider that our cities are different both in terms of topography, climate and how they are built. Our models are easy to adapt for new use cases which is underlined by the various customer groups we have onboarded &#8212; from construction developers to municipal caseworkers and infrastructure owners.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The future of Kenya-based <a href="https://sky.garden/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sky.Garden</a> &#8212; an Amazon-style marketplace for third-party merchants to sell electronics, home goods and more &#8212; is in the balance after the startup failed to close a round of financing, according to a memo the startup sent out to employees.</p>
<p>An insider told TechCrunch that the startup’s co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://dk.linkedin.com/in/martinmajlund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Majlund</a>, sent termination notices to employees earlier this month after a town hall meeting, during which he revealed that the company was running out money and will close on October 16.</p>
<p>However, contacted by TechCrunch, Majlund said that while the startup is facing a cash crunch, Sky.Garden was still in talks with investors and potential buyers in the hope of saving it from collapse.</p>
<p>“Sky.Garden Limited is still solvent and operations are still ongoing. We are in dialogue with potential investors and acquirers but as we have to be diligent about doing things the right way, we chose on September 16th to give our staff 30 days’ notice while working on our opportunities,” said Maljund, adding that 2022 has been a very tough year for startups/scaleups in general.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The e-commerce boom is still afoot in Africa, Jumia&#8217;s earnings indicate&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/17/the-e-commerce-boom-is-still-afoot-in-africa-jumias-earnings-indicate/embed/#?secret=9YxdOqJ7TX#?secret=CPAn01H5jL" data-secret="CPAn01H5jL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>VCs in developed markets have been warning of a funding winter — with the pace and size of investments in startups slowing down considerably in the wake of other declines in the market — and that has been playing out even more in emerging markets like Kenya, too.</p>
<p>Majlund noted that the overall market in 2022 has been a struggle. Some of that may have been masked by a handful of mega rounds that catapulted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/09/in-africa-kenyan-startups-have-so-far-recorded-highest-funding-growth-this-year/">Kenya to the top of the ranks for startup funding</a> on the African continent earlier this year. But by and large, VCs have pulled away from new investments, and those who are making them are doing so at a slower pace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Rising prices, inflation, war in Ukraine and increased interest rates has made the venture capital space very challenging, especially being a B2C e-commerce business,&#8221; Majlund noted. &#8220;We have therefore for a while been in deep M&amp;A conversations. But we are not the only ones being hurt by the macroeconomic contractions which have had a negative implication on the timeline of these conversations leaving us in the above-mentioned situation.”</p>
<p>Sky.Garden raised $4 million in a Series A round of funding last year, bringing the total amount it had raised from VCs to $5.2 million. The startup has been around since 2017 and has thousands of small and medium-sized businesses selling through its online marketplace. The startup ensures “end-to-end” fulfillment of orders, and earns an 8% commission for every sale made through its platform.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a model perhaps made most popular by Amazon, although the e-commerce behemoth&#8217;s success in executing that has been largely on the back of huge economies of scale that has given it more diversification and helped it balance declines in some areas against expansions in others.</p>
<p>But despite Sky.Garden’s reach in Kenya with merchants and buyers, the company itself is a much smaller affair, with just 46 employees, according to LinkedIn records.</p>
<p>Sky.Garden is a well-known brand in cities like Nairobi, where it promised deliveries of goods purchased on the platform within 24 hours. But it’s not clear how much the company was making in revenues, or how that figure has grown or declined over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sky.Garden has had a positive impact on thousands of small businesses, hundreds of thousands of consumers and hundreds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boda_boda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boda boda</a> drivers for the past six years. We strongly believe we can continue this impact with the right partner going forward,&#8221; Majlund added.</p>
<p>Even scale can be elusive and profitability long in coming when it comes to e-commerce. In Kenya, Sky.Garden offered direct competition to NYSE-listed Jumia, Africa&#8217;s biggest e-commerce marketplace, which is still not profitable over a decade after launch, despite reports of growing e-commerce uptake in Africa.</p>
<p>And as companies like Jumia continue to record growth in revenues, customers and basket value, the reality is that e-commerce marketplaces in Africa are cash-intensive ventures that suffer numerous hurdles, not least those associated with hesitancy among consumers and merchants to pay before a good is received, and to use payment cards to do so. Most players have had to build in cash-on-delivery options, which in themselves are less efficient and come with their own challenges.</p>
<p>The absence of a reliable national courier service also means that most e-commerce companies have had to set up in-house dispatch teams, an expensive undertaking.</p>
<p>All of these have played into Sky.Garden&#8217;s own story, and raises the question of how other smaller startups in the same category will fare in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As younger consumers are shifting to social apps that focus on video and more personal forms of social networking, a new social app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/studio-the-group-camcorder/id1582843261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studio</a>, launching today, is introducing a group camcorder experience that allows groups of friends to share videos with one another in private albums.</p>
<p>These albums, or &#8220;studios&#8221; as they&#8217;re called, are available to everyone in the group as a way to record and share everyday memories or vlogs in a more creative format than seen in your standard group chat.</p>
<p>The app is today launching to the general public, backed by $3.3 million in seed funding led by GV&#8217;s M.G. Siegler.</p>
<p>Studio co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-hidalgo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Hidalgo</a>, previously of Cockroach Labs and Twitter, explains how the startup landed on this idea of collaborative short-form video.</p>
<p>Initially, the team had explored other ideas in social, including a photo-based bookmarking tool called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/collie/id1495720414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collie</a>, which confirmed there was some level of user demand for a collaborative, but private, social networking experience. That app gained traction with high schoolers over the summer who used it to make bucket lists.</p>
<p>But the format Collie used didn&#8217;t quite hit the mark, leading the team to turn to the idea of using video instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;The younger generation&#8230;have this insatiable appetite and desire to consume video and to create video,&#8221; says Hidalgo. &#8220;And it&#8217;s still a format that I would say is very under-explored &#8212; a lot of the bigger apps that are out there do video and video editing in a very distinct way that stems from where they started,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We believe that there&#8217;s a lot more interactivity and dimension to explore with video.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2412570" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2412570" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2412570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-product.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="368" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-product.png 9936w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-product.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-product.png?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-product.png?resize=768,416 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-product.png?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-product.png?resize=1536,831 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-product.png?resize=2048,1108 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-product.png?resize=1200,649 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-product.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2412570" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Studio</p></div></p>
<p>With Studio, users open up the app to a camera that looks like an old-fashioned camcorder, then record videos that are up to 10 seconds long which are saved to the private, shared albums known as studios. The idea is to use the albums as a way to record and stitch together the group&#8217;s everyday memories in a way that elevates them creatively. It shouldn&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re recording causal Snapchat videos, but rather mini-episodes of a broader story. Hidalgo likens the experience to crafting collaborative &#8220;TV shows,&#8221; in a sense.</p>
<p>The company landed on this idea when it found its power users were leveraging the app to record highlights for their school clubs or sports teams &#8212; like recording videos for game day or other events. It reminded Hidalgo of how his parents would film home movies that would entertain the family as they watched them back over the years. Studio aims to offer a similar vibe.</p>

<p>However, the app as it stands today is more bare bones than some might expect from today&#8217;s social apps, which are often cluttered with AR effects, filters, editing tools and more. In Studio, you can invite friends to a room, record 10-second videos together (which are aggregated each day as &#8220;episodes&#8221;), add captions &#8212; and not much more.</p>
<p>It felt odd that there wasn&#8217;t even a built-in way to &#8220;react&#8221; to friends&#8217; videos, by adding likes or comments, as is standard on social apps. But that&#8217;s by design, Hidalgo notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our prevailing way of building product was to build the most stripped-down version possible [and] test out the core mechanic,&#8221; he says, adding that the app has no commenting or chatting. Instead, users are meant to react by recording their own videos to continue the &#8220;episode.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, the idea for a group video app isn&#8217;t novel. Studio shares some similarities with other video apps from years past, like the video texting app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/video-texting-app-glide-is-going-viral-now-ranked-just-ahead-of-instagram-in-app-store/">Glide, which once topped Instagram</a> for a time. The concept is also reminiscent of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flashtape-1-second-everyday/id1584196526?l=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flashtape</a>, the video texting app from the creators of YOLO, but lengthens the supported video time frame from 1 second to 10 as a differentiator.</p>
<p>Still, top social app BeReal wasn&#8217;t entirely novel either &#8212; it&#8217;s very much inspired by an older social app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/22/frontback-is-a-deeply-personal-photo-taking-app-to-capture-fleeting-moments/">FrontBack</a>. It simply introduced the dual camera concept to a new generation of users, and has now grown to reach 46 million global installs and a top 10 position on the App Store in over a dozen countries.</p>
<p>GV&#8217;s Siegler, who returned to seed investing around a year and a half ago, says he&#8217;s interested in the potential for new social apps catering to a younger audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;With what&#8217;s going on with the large companies&#8230;it does feel like there&#8217;s this time of &#8212; if it&#8217;s not a full-on changing of the guard, it feels like people are at least opening up again to trying new things,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;There&#8217;s been this lingering feeling that these [larger social] networks are getting up there in age. The demographics have shifted &#8212; and young people are looking for what&#8217;s next and are trying different types of networks.&#8221;</p>

<p>He believes Studio&#8217;s team is looking to build more slowly and methodically to capture its audience, instead of trying to blow up overnight as a viral sensation, as many social apps now do today on TikTok.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be a lot of micro-pivots along the way and, listening to their user base about what it is that they actually want to build,&#8221; he notes.</p>
<p>New York-based Studio is a team of three co-founders, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-mohile-6b475550/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aditya Mohile</span></a> (previously of Facebook) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-chao-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Chao</span></a>, in addition to Hidalgo, as well as two interns.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Software product marketers typically are charged with creating demos for potential customers. These let people who are interested in the product see how a function inside an application works as a way to whet the appetite of the potential buyer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.arcade.software/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=deepinthetrenches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arcade</a>, a startup launched by two former Atlassian employees, decided to attack this problem with a simple Chrome extension to build demos quickly that product people can make use of in various settings.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced the product, which has been in private beta for the last eight months, is available to the public. The startup also announced that it has received $7.5 million in total seed investment.</p>
<p>Arcade co-founder and CEO Caroline Clark says that the product is about empowering people to make interactive demos very quickly. “We allow product marketers, or anyone in go-to-market, to build interactive snippets of the product that they can then embed on websites, social media and blog posts,” she said.</p>
<p>She adds, “The whole goal of our product is that you allow the customers to try before they buy so that they can get an understanding of what the product can do before they invest with a credit card, before deploying their own data, before they go through the whole implementation process.”</p>
<p>If you’re thinking that’s what a free trial is for, she said this about getting potential customers interested, even before they get to that stage. “There are so many different parts of the journey before they get to the free trial…And so our main goal is that if you&#8217;re in a social media campaign, or even a blog post that&#8217;s outside of the website property, you can see right there in that context, how the product works,” Clark explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2412554" style="width: 2090px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2412554" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2412554 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-9.31.22-AM.png" alt="Arcade product demo example." width="2080" height="1374" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-9.31.22-AM.png 2080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-9.31.22-AM.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-9.31.22-AM.png?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-9.31.22-AM.png?resize=768,507 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-9.31.22-AM.png?resize=680,449 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-9.31.22-AM.png?resize=1536,1015 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-9.31.22-AM.png?resize=2048,1353 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-9.31.22-AM.png?resize=1200,793 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-9.31.22-AM.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2080px) 100vw, 2080px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2412554" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arcade</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company reports that since they went into private beta earlier this year, more than 1,000 companies have generated 4,000 demos using the product. Today they have eight employees, but Clark reports they are hiring, particularly in customer success and sales.</p>
<p>As a female founder, she sees how few investment dollars are flowing to women, and she says it’s probably not a coincidence that several of her earliest investors are women. She is looking to find diverse talent to fill roles whenever possible as she builds her own employee base. She says that one way to do that is controlling what she can control in the process.</p>
<p>“What I do is look at my outreach. I&#8217;m very focused on underrepresented groups, so you can control the outreach, but you can&#8217;t control the inbound so we try to compensate for that [with direct outreach],” she said.</p>
<p>The $7.5 million seed funding came in two tranches. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/arcade-try-before-you-buy-demo/">scored $2.5 million in January</a> led by Upfront Ventures, Sequoia and several industry angels, including Front CEO Mathilde Collin and Shippo CEO Laura Behrens Wu.</p>
<p>The second piece, a $5 million investment, was led by Joanne Chen at Foundation Ventures, along with several other industry angels. Chen will be joining Arcade’s board under the terms of the deal.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The advent of SaaS and cloud-based software services has all but obliterated the traditional sales model, but not many organizations are actually helping their sales teams adapt to this new world order.</p>
<p>Sales training statistics paint a grim picture. Even if business leaders know their employees need support, they often aren’t providing the right kind of support. Some organizations provide no sales training at all, and others simply miss the mark. According to one study, roughly <a href="https://trainingindustry.com/magazine/issue/sales-training-is-it-worth-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">44% of sales representatives felt their training “needed improvement.”</a></p>
<p>How can sales leaders and other stakeholders improve how they train the modern sales force?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to recognize that today’s sales teams are more problem-solvers than deal-closers — soft skills are more important here than technical capabilities. They need to develop flexible ways of thinking and solving problems, become able to navigate ever-present uncertainty, manage time well, and be resilient.</p>
<p>Every sales team is composed of vastly different individuals who possess distinctive soft skills, behaviors and mindsets. That’s why personalized approaches to learning and development initiatives, like one-on-one coaching, can be so transformative.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			A coach should design each coaching journey based on an individual’s growth and learning goals.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Personalized coaching programs meet sales professionals where they are to help them become better versions of themselves. To realize the power of personalized coaching, sales leaders and other stakeholders should create a coaching culture that supports sales professionals at every level of their career.</p>
<p>Here’s how:</p>
<h2>Identify a sales coach</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, there are two kinds of business coaches — external and internal. External coaches are typically certified third-party partners. Conversely, internal coaches work for the company and could be sales leaders, HR executives or other managers.</p>
<p>While both types of coaches can be effective, internal coaches face some barriers and must proactively:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Commit to confidentiality:</strong> Coaches must create psychologically safe environments for employees to express concerns like professional weaknesses, interpersonal challenges and known biases. If employees fear repercussions from their coaching sessions, they won’t be honest, and the coaching won&#8217;t achieve its full potential.</li>
<li><strong>Prevent role confusion:</strong> Internal coaches could interact with employees outside of regular coaching sessions, so they must set clear expectations for how the coach-learner relationship differs from other professional relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise objectivity:</strong> While internal coaches have the benefit of understanding a workplace’s cultural nuances, politics and strategy, they must avoid institutional biases and approach coaching sessions with impartiality.</li>
</ol>

<p>A key difference is that the most successful product-led companies only reach out to a small portion of users that sign up for their product — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/07/as-investors-focus-more-on-profitability-product-led-startups-may-be-sitting-pretty/">14%</a>, according to OpenView’s third annual product benchmarks report.</p>
<p>For companies hoping to emulate the success of Figma, Slack, Zoom and the like, this leaves a tough question to solve: Which of their users should they reach out to, and when?</p>
<p>Uncovering sales opportunities is what Swedish startup <a href="http://getripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripe</a> is offering its product-led clients. The role of its platform is to help them &#8220;understand which users are both successful and fit their ideal customer profiles, and what next steps to take with them,&#8221; its CEO and co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elinlutz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elin Lütz</a>, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Lütz and her co-founder, Jonatan Dykert, have firsthand experience building SaaS products and realized that product-led companies don&#8217;t necessarily need more data: They just need to be able to connect the dots between product and sales, which is what Ripe does.</p>
<p>The duo joined forces to found their company in Stockholm in 2021, which was initially called Chimer. Lütz explained that the new name is meant to reflect the company&#8217;s role in helping customers &#8220;target the right ripest accounts within [their] own existing use cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>The data that Ripe is relying on comes from clients themselves — but from various sources that were previously disconnected and inaccessible to sales teams.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We saw that there was something very strange happening with data being stuck in the product […] and not served throughout the whole organization,&#8221; Lütz said. &#8220;There was a huge discrepancy between what sales worked with and how product worked.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a product-led company, it is critical for customer success teams to have access to product usage data; otherwise, they have no way of knowing which users are worth their time. Static profile data doesn&#8217;t help much; they need to know who&#8217;s engaging with the product and how.</p>
<p>Think of signing up for a freemium product: How will the company behind it know if you are just a single user who will never leave the free tier or someone who represents an enterprise-sized lead? In a sales-driven process, the sales team would already know. With bottom-up adoption, which is more and more common, answering this question requires connecting data.</p>
<p>The fact that more B2B companies are adopting a freemium model undoubtedly creates tailwinds for companies like Ripe.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way that enterprise software is being purchased has shifted, attributing most of the buying power to the end-user. Yet, there is no infrastructure allowing sellers and buyers to instantly connect with each other,&#8221; VC Paul Klemm said. &#8220;Entering into this relationship at the right time and manner represents a huge opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Klemm is a partner at European venture fund <a href="http://www.earlybird.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earlybird Venture Capital</a>, which co-led Ripe&#8217;s $2 million pre-seed round alongside Norway-based firm <a href="https://alliance.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alliance Venture</a>. Individuals from Europe&#8217;s B2B SaaS and tech scene also participated in the funding round, such as Pleo&#8217;s and Mentimeter&#8217;s VPs of sales, Soundtrap&#8217;s co-founder and Livi&#8217;s CEO and CTO, Ripe said.</p>

But with a growing number of businesses adopting product-led growth, there seems to be plenty of space for service providers that can help them avoid building their own internal dashboards. After SaaS for SaaS, companies enabling product-led growth are a new trend to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rise in software supply chain attacks, like the SolarWinds hack, prompted last year’s executive order from the Biden Administration requiring vendors to provide a software bill of materials (SBOM). SBOMs can help security teams understand if a newly disclosed vulnerability impacts them &#8212; in theory. But industry experts caution that they aren&#8217;t always comprehensive enough to prevent attacks or address the challenges of securing supply chains.</p>
<p>One startup, <a href="https://www.ox.security/">Ox Security</a>, is forging ahead with an alternative to SBOMs it&#8217;s calling Pipeline Bill of Materials (PBOM), which Ox claims goes further by covering not only the code in final software products but also the procedures and processes that impacted the software throughout its development. PBOM seems to be gaining traction. Despite being founded less than a year ago, Ox has raised $34 million in seed funding &#8212; a fact that it disclosed today &#8212; and has 30 customers including FICO, Kaltura and Marqeta.</p>
<p>Investors to date include Evolution Equity Partners, Team8, Rain Capital and M12, Microsoft’s venture fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the infamous SolarWinds attack took place, I recall the amount of stress that was felt across the industry,&#8221; CEO Neatsun Ziv, a former Check Point executive, told TechCrunch in an email interview. &#8220;When brainstorming on ideas with my co-founder Lior Arzi, we talked about the need for an end-to-end supply chain solution &#8212; something that doesn’t only look at the code that goes into the end product but also at all of the procedures and processes that could have impacted the software throughout the whole development lifecycle. At the end of 2021, we founded Ox Security to build this solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>In developing PBOM, Ziv claims that Ox undertook &#8220;extensive&#8221; research on the root causes of more than 70 attacks from the past year. PBOM was designed to contain information that might&#8217;ve prevented the attacks had it been readily available at the time, he says, and to be shared with stakeholders so that they can verify that the software they&#8217;re using is derived from a trusted, secure build.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2406062" style="width: 1810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2406062" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2406062 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/See-everything-that-affects-your-software.jpeg" alt="Ox Security" width="1800" height="1200" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/See-everything-that-affects-your-software.jpeg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/See-everything-that-affects-your-software.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/See-everything-that-affects-your-software.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/See-everything-that-affects-your-software.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/See-everything-that-affects-your-software.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/See-everything-that-affects-your-software.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/See-everything-that-affects-your-software.jpeg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/See-everything-that-affects-your-software.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2406062" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ox Security</p></div></p>
<p>Ox&#8217;s platform, leveraging PBOM, integrates with existing software development tools and infrastructure to record actions affecting software throughout the development lifecycle. It connects to an organization&#8217;s code repository and performs a scan of the environment from &#8220;code to cloud,&#8221; producing a map of detectable assets, apps and pipelines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ox also attempts to identify which security tools are in use, verify that they’re operational, and determine if additional tools are needed. Then, the platform highlights any security issues it found, prioritized by their business impact alongside automated fixes and recommendations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most IT departments are understaffed, lack visibility and are struggling to prioritize security projects across engineering and DevOps. This results in &#8216;shadow dev&#8217; and DevOps — where software development tools and processes are outside of the control and ownership of the security teams,&#8221; Ziv continued. &#8220;There is also a severe lack of automation that results in manual work and causes a high attrition rate for people in these roles. The Ox platform solves these issues by providing continuous visibility, prioritizing risks, automating manual workflows and securing the posture of [software development] elements like GitLab, Jenkins, artifact registry and production.&#8221;</p>
<p>PBOM is &#8212; at least at present &#8212; a voluntary spec. And Ox competes with vendors like Legit Security, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cycode-raises-56m-series-b-to-help-secure-software-supply-chains/">Cycode</a>, and Apiiro, the last of which Palo Alto Networks is reportedly <a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-palo-alto-close-to-buying-israeli-cyber-co-apiiro-1001425046">close</a> to acquiring for $550 million. But Ziv asserts that OX is gaining mindshare, pointing to the startup&#8217;s client base of just over 30 brands.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are fully focused on building the company and scaling the number of customers we serve. So far we only see an increase in demand due to the increasing number of attacks,&#8221; Ziv said. &#8220;If you look at previous downturns, there were very successful companies that got started in each one of them. So we try to obsess about solving the security risk, rather than what could happen with the market. We are going on this journey with strong partners who want to see this vision come to life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Added M12 managing partner Mony Hassid in an emailed statement: &#8220;Supply chain attacks are on the rise, and the attack surface is growing. When it comes to software security and integrity, you have to look beyond which components were used and consider the overall security posture throughout the development process. Ox is pioneering a standard that will be transformative for supply chain security. We&#8217;re proud to work with OX to improve software security.”</p>
<p>With the proceeds from the seed round, Ox plans to double its 30-employee headcount by the end of 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Software-as-a-service dev platform <a href="http://airplane.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airplane</a> today closed a $32 million Series B funding round led by Thrive Capital with participation from Benchmark, bringing the startup&#8217;s total raised to $40.5 million. Ravi Parikh says that the new funds will be put toward growing Airplane&#8217;s 19-person team while expanding its product to new markets.</p>
<p>Airplane was founded in 2020 by Parikh and Josh Ma, who was formerly the CTO at Benchling, a cloud-based platform for biotechnology R&amp;D. Parikh previously co-founded analytics startup Heap, which offers tools to analyze customer journeys online. Parikh and Ma left their respective companies in 2020 after realizing that one of the biggest challenges in software development is a lack of internal tooling.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just a hunch on their parts. According to one recent vendor <a href="https://retool.com/blog/state-of-internal-tools-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a>, developers spent more than 30% of their time building internal apps in 2021. The pandemic worsened matters, with 87% of respondents saying that they increased or maintained their time spent on internal apps in response to the health crises.</p>
<p>&#8220;[We&#8217;ve spoken] to tons of engineers who spend 25% to 50% of their time responding to customer requests, building and maintaining internal admin panels, maintaining cron jobs, on-call runbooks and more instead of pushing the product forward &#8230; At Heap, we had tons of one-off customer requests, like deleting data, merging accounts, GDPR operations and billing operations,&#8221; Parikh said. &#8220;We created Airplane to make it easy to take these one-off engineering operations and turn them into tools anyone at a company can use.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2391678" style="width: 2892px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2391678" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2391678 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gs-runbooks-session.png" alt="Airplane" width="2882" height="1462" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gs-runbooks-session.png 2882w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gs-runbooks-session.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gs-runbooks-session.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gs-runbooks-session.png?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gs-runbooks-session.png?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gs-runbooks-session.png?resize=1536,779 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gs-runbooks-session.png?resize=2048,1039 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gs-runbooks-session.png?resize=1200,609 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gs-runbooks-session.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2882px) 100vw, 2882px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2391678" class="wp-caption-text">Building an app using Airplane. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Airplane</p></div></p>
<p>Parikh acknowledges there are platforms already addressing these internal tooling challenges, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/28/retool-raises-45m-at-a-3-2b-valuation-to-make-building-custom-software-as-easy-as-buying-off-the-shelf/">Retool</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/11/superblocks-secures-37m-to-help-companies-build-and-maintain-internal-apps/">Superblocks</a> &#8212; both of which recently secured tens of millions in venture capital backing. But he argues that Airplane is more developer-centric and &#8220;code-first,&#8221; eschewing a low-code, drag-and-drop approach to creating apps for more specialized tools and workflows.</p>
<p>With Airplane, developers can select from a library of tables, forms, charts and more to built apps, which can be integrated with APIs and custom components or libraries. The platform supports databases and messaging platforms out of the box and can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, giving devs the raw tools to launch apps like billing dashboards and content moderation queues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Airplane today launched Airplane Views, a framework for creating internal tooling visual interfaces. Airplane was previously focused on code-heavy internal apps for tasks like deleting user data, refunding a charge and banning a user. But Airplane Views allows developers to create app components that act like dashboards, for example to display certain key metrics.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most common use cases is software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies using Airplane Views to build internal admin panels for their customer success and support teams. SaaS companies use Airplane to create [interfaces] where they can look up customer data, view account metrics and make account changes like suspending users or upgrading a customer’s account,&#8221; Parikh said. &#8220;Another important use case is fraud detection &#8230; [W]ith Views, companies can build more sophisticated fraud monitoring [interfaces] where the right user data is displayed contextually next to these operations, making the lives of ops and risk teams significantly easier when using Airplane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric Vishria, a general partner at Benchmark who recently joined Airplane&#8217;s board of directors, highlighted what he sees as the other benefits of the platform, such as controls that allow engineers to grant access to data deletion requests to anyone in a business. In theory, these minimize the need for engineers to get involved with every such request &#8212; removing a common bottleneck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Today, virtually every company runs a software service,&#8221; Vishria said via email. &#8220;Disney used to make content, now it also has to run Disney+. Banks used to store money, now they compete on their apps. Every one of these cloud services has an unmanaged mountain of scripts, cron jobs, SQL statements and internal dashboards that keep it running. Airplane is the first company taking a developer-first approach to bringing order to this 50% of &#8216;code&#8217; that lives in the wilderness today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parikh cautions that it&#8217;s early days; he declined to share revenue metrics. But he revealed that Airplane has almost 100 paying customers currently, including startups Vercel, Panther Labs and Flatfile.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re not yet profitable, but this funding round plus our current revenue gives us several years of runway even with aggressive growth plans &#8230; We’re fortunate to have a product that can save a lot of engineering time as well as significantly improve customer experience. During a period when companies are tightening their belts and looking for ways to improve efficiency, Airplane is easy to justify,&#8221; Parikh said with confidence. &#8220;[But] our product today only solves a small portion of this huge problem and there’s a lot more we need to build to create a broad platform for internal tool development.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://detectify.com/">Detectify</a>, a security platform that employs ethical hackers to conduct attacks designed to highlight vulnerabilities in corporate systems, today announced that it raised $10 million in follow-on funding led by Insight Partners. CEO Richard Carlsson says that the new cash, which brings Detectify&#8217;s total raised to $42 million, will be put toward product development and improving the overall user experience.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detectify was founded by four ethical hackers from Stockholm, including Carlsson, who realized the business potential in combining security research with automation. In an interview with TechCrunch, Carlsson pointed out that p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">roduct development workflows have changed dramatically over the past few years, with new teams within organizations spinning up internet-facing apps and adding potentially vulnerable assets to their employer&#8217;s environment. The trend toward low- and no-code tools has lowered the app development barrier to entry, but it&#8217;s also made the jobs of security specialists that much harder.</span></p>
<p>Illustrating the challenges, a recent Dark Reading <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/tech-trends/low-code-no-code-tools-are-popular-but-untrusted">survey</a> found that 26% of IT and security experts don&#8217;t trust the platforms used to create low- and no-code apps. Roughly as many &#8212; 25% &#8212; said that they don&#8217;t even know which apps within their companies are being created by these tools.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While companies should integrate security best practices earlier in their development cycle and try to catch vulnerabilities in development, production is what truly matters,&#8221; Carlsson added via email. &#8220;Unless you have a completely linear development process, which no company actually has, you will never catch everything. And this legacy mindset and over-reliance on &#8216;shifting left&#8217; instills a sense of false confidence in organizations that actually increases their risk level.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2411277" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2411277" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2411277" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vuln4.jpg" alt="Detectify" width="1024" height="666" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vuln4.jpg 3894w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vuln4.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vuln4.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vuln4.jpg?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vuln4.jpg?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vuln4.jpg?resize=1536,998 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vuln4.jpg?resize=2048,1331 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vuln4.jpg?resize=1200,780 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vuln4.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2411277" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Detectify</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detectify&#8217;s approach crowdsources real payloads &#8212; pieces of code that execute when hacker exploits a vulnerability &#8212; from a private community of ethical hackers and uses these contributions for payload-based tests. Carlsson claims that Detectify tests customers&#8217; entire attack surfaces, exposing how malicious attackers might exploit internet-facing apps in production. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the near future, Detectify plans to roll out new functionality that&#8217;ll give security teams the ability to create custom alert policies. Teams will be notified if attacks on vectors like hosts, domains or DNS records are detected, Carlsson says. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With Detectify, organizations can maintain an external point-of-view of exactly how attackers would exploit their attack surface, manage exposure, and prioritize their remediation efforts,&#8221; Carlsson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detectify currently has 2,000 customers, including &#8220;large government digital services&#8221; in Europe, and a user base exceeding 10,000. Carlsson asserts that demand remains robust in the face of competition like Cycognito, Crowdstrike&#8217;s Reposify, IBM&#8217;s Randori, Google&#8217;s Mandiant and Microsoft&#8217;s RiskIQ, driven by digital transformation efforts around the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it simply, the external attack surface has never been more complicated and harder to defend. This insulates Detectify against market headwinds,&#8221; he added. &#8220;While no company is immune to market trends, in cybersecurity, the pressure to reduce spend is pitted against cybersecurity teams&#8217; need for best-of-breed solutions to protect the business against nation-state-level attacks.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin Kõiva</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was at Pipedrive, leading the company&#8217;s customer support organization, when he says he came to the realization that the best way to prevent bad customer interactions is to analyze previous ones, give agents regular check-ins and not rely too strictly on customer feedback. But Kõiva was hampered in his efforts to implement these practices at scale because the tools to do so didn&#8217;t exist, he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking to build them himself, Kõiva teamed up with Kair Käsper (also ex-Pipedrive) and Egon Sale to co-found <a href="http://klausapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klaus</a>, a customer support product that </span>integrates with clients&#8217; customer relationship management platforms (e.g., Zendesk, Salesforce Service Cloud) to automatically review customer support conversations from channels like web chats. Klaus today closed a €12 million (~$11.49 million) Series A equity round led by Acton Capital, which <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kõiva</span> says will be used to support the development and further expansion of Klaus&#8217;s software.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For large companies that have millions of support tickets, it is crucial that managers are able to find the conversations that have a meaningful impact on performance. It’s a needle in a haystack,&#8221; Kõiva told TechCrunch in an email interview. &#8220;Klaus is able to automatically analyze the entire customer support volume and pinpoint which conversations require attention.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drawing on customer support tickets, input from managers reviewing agent conversations and customer satisfaction feedback, Klaus trains AI algorithms to perform tasks like automatically categorizing comments from customers and sorting conversations by attributes like complexity. Klaus can perform sentiment analysis in a number of languages out of the box, Kõiva claims, a capability the platform uses to score the &#8220;quality&#8221; of customer-agent conversations. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2409062" style="width: 2410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2409062" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2409062 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fde2407b-customer-service-qa@2x.jpg" alt="Klaus" width="2400" height="1256" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fde2407b-customer-service-qa@2x.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fde2407b-customer-service-qa@2x.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fde2407b-customer-service-qa@2x.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fde2407b-customer-service-qa@2x.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fde2407b-customer-service-qa@2x.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fde2407b-customer-service-qa@2x.jpg?resize=1536,804 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fde2407b-customer-service-qa@2x.jpg?resize=2048,1072 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fde2407b-customer-service-qa@2x.jpg?resize=1200,628 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fde2407b-customer-service-qa@2x.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2409062" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Klaus</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Klaus [can] piece together what &#8216;good&#8217; and &#8216;bad&#8217; looks like for each individual customer and, with the help of data science, deliver actionable insights that improve customer service for companies that have millions of support tickets every month,&#8221; Kõiva said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klaus technology is currently analyzing two million customer conversations every day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Automated scoring systems, particularly those that rely on potentially <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/emotion-ai-sentiment-analysis-difference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biased</a> sentiment analysis techniques, raise questions about whether customer agents might be evaluated inaccurately or unfairly. When asked about factors like bias, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kõiva said that Klaus takes mitigating steps like removing color-, region-, and gender-specific emojis in the customer feedback data that its algorithms analyze. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Klaus competes with companies such as <span style="font-weight: 400;">MaestroQA, Playvox and Stella Connect. Beyond those, there&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/01/scopeai-seed-funding/">ScopeAI</a>, acquired by Observe.AI in 2021 for its technology that helps companies analyze customer feedback, and Zendesk-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/zendesk-acquires-ai-automation-startup-cleverly-to-advance-customer-service/">Cleverly</a>, which automatically tags incoming customer service requests to help categorize the workflow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kõiva believes Klaus is well-positioned, however, with a customer base totaling &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of companies, including Epic Games, SoundCloud and WordPress.com. To continue to stand out, Klaus recently added customer satisfaction survey functionality with automatic tagging, allowing admins to spot trends that they might otherwise miss.  </span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Klaus has &#8230; seen an uptick in interest from companies that are looking to optimize their customer service operations,&#8221; Kõiva continued. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large enterprises also tend to use more outsourced customer service to keep costs flexible during uncertain [economic] times, and Klaus provides a degree of confidence that the quality of the outsourced service is under control.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Klaus currently employs around 60 people, a number <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kõiva expects will grow to over 100 within the next six months. To date, the startup has raised more than $19 million in venture capital.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The digital ads market is robust, with Statista <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/237974/online-advertising-spending-worldwide/#:~:text=It%20was%20calculated%20that%20the,would%20reach%20876%20billion%20dollars.&amp;text=Advertising%20can%20utilize%20almost%20any%20form%20of%20media%20to%20meet%20its%20needs." target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicting</a> that worldwide spend will reach nearly $900 billion by 2026. But fake and fraudulent ad traffic remains a major problem in the space. Global losses from ad fraud totaled <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1117175/digital-ad-fraud-economic-loss-world/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20advertising%20fraud%20inflicted,10%20percent%20of%20the%20total." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.statista.com/statistics/1117175/digital-ad-fraud-economic-loss-world/%23:~:text%3DIn%25202020%252C%2520advertising%2520fraud%2520inflicted,10%2520percent%2520of%2520the%2520total.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1663853639776000&amp;usg=AOvVaw13J7cjwne08oyI_-q_zZX6">$35 billion in 2020 alone</a>. And beyond the wasted spend, invalid traffic can inflate metrics, leading brands to misidentify &#8212; and misunderstand &#8212; customer segments.</p>
<p>To combat ad fraud, Neil Andrew, Segev Hochberg and Alex Winston co-founded <a href="http://lunio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lunio</a>, which attempts to exclude fake web traffic arriving from different channels by analyzing behavior patterns. The startup today announced that it closed a $15 million Series A round led by Smedvig Capital, bringing Lunio&#8217;s total raised to around $17 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back in 2016, we were running a digital marketing agency in the U.K. and working closely with one of their top clients, Segev Hochberg,&#8221; Andrew told TechCrunch in an email interview. &#8220;During that time, they kept noticing the same problem. Worthless clicks from fake users were eating away a chunk of Segev’s marketing budget every month. And ad networks weren’t exactly rushing to tackle the problem, because there was no real incentive for them to do so. So Neil, Segev, and I founded Lunio to help other marketers catch and block clicks from bad sources, while automatically reinvesting the money saved back into top-performing ad campaigns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lunio claims to use a combination of data analysis and cybersecurity techniques to catch and block fake clicks, with algorithms that run client-side &#8212; within a user&#8217;s browser &#8212; to ensure personally identifiable information isn&#8217;t sent over the web. (While the IP addresses of ad interactions are stored and provided to users, they&#8217;re not combined with any other information that could make them personally identifiable, Andrew claims.) The algorithms attempt to predict the likelihood of invalid click activity on a range of ad networks, including Google, YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and even TikTok.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2404078" style="width: 925px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2404078" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2404078 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Report-Global-Click-Fraud-Report-2020-2021.png" alt="Lunio" width="915" height="499" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Report-Global-Click-Fraud-Report-2020-2021.png 915w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Report-Global-Click-Fraud-Report-2020-2021.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Report-Global-Click-Fraud-Report-2020-2021.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Report-Global-Click-Fraud-Report-2020-2021.png?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Report-Global-Click-Fraud-Report-2020-2021.png?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Report-Global-Click-Fraud-Report-2020-2021.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2404078" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lunio</p></div></p>
<p>While Lunio is far from the first click fraud prevention tech vendor &#8212; others include CHEQ and Human Security &#8212; Andrew asserts that its platform has key technical advantages. For example, Lunio&#8217;s algorithms leverage WebAssembly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web standard</a> designed to enable near-native code execution speed in the browser, which Andrew claims is up to seven times faster than traditional JavaScript &#8212; the programming language many vendors use to analyze ad traffic.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s a huge opportunity cost of having distracted sales processes downstream due to fake lead form submissions which follow on from fake clicks. Sales reps can waste many hours chasing leads that don’t actually exist,&#8221; Andrew said. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It&#8217;s not just about getting a refund on spammy clicks &#8212; if you even manage to. It&#8217;s about stopping all the knock-on effects of having fake traffic hit your website.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Andrew says the pandemic was a boon for Lunio because it led to increases in fake user activity as brands and their customers moved online. Meanwhile, the economic downturn has increased the pressure on companies to stretch their ad dollars, Andrew says &#8212; leading to another windfall for the startup.</p>
<p>Lunio has more than 1,000 customers covering over 10,000 individual advertising accounts, Andrew claims. He opted not to share revenue figures, saying only that Lunio plans to expand headcount from 43 employees to around 55 by the end of Q1 2023 to &#8220;accelerate&#8221; its go-to-market efforts in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel very insulated from the forward-looking challenges many companies will face. We have implemented strong operational and investment discipline based on validated business cases to drive our future direction,&#8221; Andrew continued. &#8220;We operate on a best-in-class burn multiple and expect this to continue in relative terms as we scale the business.&#8221;</p>
